            This assignment was to create a java application that autonomously does the things we have been learning how to do in this class.
            That being, it should autonomously turn any project folder on the user's computer into a git repo on their computer as well as on GitHub
            and provide the user with a link to said repo.

            This is done through many steps, first implementing JFrame to allow the user to click and type on and in different text boxes and buttons.
            Next we had to implement different git api tools that allowed us to type the git commands into the actual code rather than the terminal
            as we have been for most of the semester.
