                Welcome to the website for the GitRepoCreator! This Java application autonomously establishes a Git repository in a given project filepath<br>
                and creates a repository for the project on GitHub thereafter. This program returns the link to the newly-created repository once all of the
                text fields have been filled out appropriately.<br>
                <br>
                This goal is accomplished through various steps, the first of which being the implementation of a JFrame UI system that allows the user to click on and type in different text boxes and buttons.
                Next, a Git Subprocessing Client and API tool allow for the execution of Git commands throughout the code rather than needing to manually
                type them out in the terminal.

                <ol>
                    <li>Download the source code from <a href=https://github.com/jjnoga/GitRepoCreator>this</a> GitHub link!<br></li>
                    <li>Ensure that your Java version is at least 17. (Install from <a href=https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows>this website</a>.)<br></li>
                    <li>Download the required GitSubprocessClient and GitHubApiClient libraries as .jar files from the websites in <a href=https://github.com/CSC109/GitSubprocessClient>this</a> and <a href=https://github.com/CSC109/GitHubApiClient>this</a> repository respectively.<br></li>
                    <li>Integrate these new libraries within your IDE.<br></li>
                </ol>
                &emsp;- If you are using Visual Studio Code (which you most likely are if you're seeing this website), open the IDE, drop down the header that says "Java Projects" <br>
                &emsp;towards the bottom of the Explorer tab.<br>
                &emsp;- Drop down the "Referenced Libraries" tab within Java Projects, and copy/paste the .jar files inside. You should now have the required libraries to run the program!<br>
